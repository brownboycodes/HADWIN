# Contributing to HADWIN

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Discussing the current state of the code 👩‍💻📈
- Submitting a fix 🩹
- Proposing new features ✨

<br>

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- file names should in `snake_case`
- files should be name after the widget it contains, for example- if a file contains the class `UserInfo` the file name should be `user_info.dart`
- the class names should be meaningful and should be according to the purpose it serves
- follow clean coding principles (check out this [cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/wojteklu/73c6914cc446146b8b533c0988cf8d29))
